Digital Immune System üõ°Ô∏è

Description:
The Digital Immune System (DIS) is a cross-platform security prototype designed to scan files, APKs, and URLs for malicious or suspicious content. It computes SHA256 hashes, analyzes APK permissions, detects phishing URLs, and manages quarantined files. The system is modular, lightweight, and works on Windows, Linux, and Android (Termux).

Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cyboy18/digital-immune-system.git
cd digital-immune-system

Step 2: Setup Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

Step 3: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
File Hash Scan
python disimmune.py scan-hash <file_path>

APK Permission Scan
python disimmune.py scan-apk <apk_path>

URL Phishing Check
python disimmune.py check-url <url>

Folder Watcher
python disimmune.py watch <folder_path> --interval 5

Quarantine Management
python disimmune.py quarantine-list
python disimmune.py quarantine-restore <filename> --restore-dir <path>

Logging & Results

All scans are logged with timestamps.

Individual scan results are saved in DigitalImmuneLogs/Scanned_Results with filenames like:

Wireshark_exe_21-09-2025_214500.txt


This allows easy review and auditing of past scans.
